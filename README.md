## `prod.keys` File Requirement
![Library](https://i.imgur.com/oTkA3Dn.png)

For the File Watcher service to function correctly, a `prod.keys` file is required. This file contains the necessary keys to decrypt and parse metadata from game files such as `.nsp`, `.nsz`, `.xci`, and `.xcz`. Without a valid `prod.keys` file, the watcher's validation and metadata reading functions will not work, and it will be unable to add new content to your library database.

This file must be obtained by you. It can typically be dumped from your own console or found through various sources online.

**Disclaimer**: We do not provide, link to, or offer any instructions on how to acquire the `prod.keys` file. You are responsible for sourcing this file yourself.

## Admin Panel Sections

### 1. Login
A secure portal for administrative access to the panel.

A unique password is generated on the first run; you'll find it at the run prompt. You must change the password in "manage profiles." If you haven't saved your password, delete the db/users.db file and restart the system.

* **Server Status**: Shows whether the core "Shop Core" is `Online` or `Offline` and displays the network port and public address Tinfoil should connect to.

    * Manage Users
    * Restart Tinfoil Server
    * Start/Stop Tinfoil Server

* **Dynamic Placeholders**: A documentation modal explains how to use placeholders like `{user}` and `{shop_title}` to insert dynamic information into the messages.
* **Special Fields**: The `BROWSER_FORBIDDEN` field supports HTML, allowing for a custom-formatted page to be shown to users who try to access the shop URL in a web browser.

### 9. Stored Logs (`stored_logs.html`)
An interface for viewing and searching the historical log database.
